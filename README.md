# Fake News Detection Using Natural Language Processing

## Project Description
This project aimed to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify news articles as either fake or legitimate based on their titles. The primary objective was to leverage the power of NLP techniques to identify misleading information, contributing to the broader effort of combating fake news in digital media.

The approach involved tokenizing the words in the news titles and preparing them for input into a classification algorithm. By transforming the text data into a format suitable for machine learning, the model was trained to recognize patterns associated with fake news. Despite achieving an accuracy of approximately 55%, this project provided valuable insights into the challenges of text classification and highlighted areas for improvement in model training and feature extraction.

## Key Highlights
- **Text Tokenization**: Implemented a tokenization process to break down news titles into individual words, facilitating the analysis of textual data.
- **NLP Techniques**: Applied various NLP techniques to preprocess the text data, including lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Classification Algorithm**: Utilized a machine learning algorithm to classify the news titles, analyzing the effectiveness of different models in detecting fake news.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Achieved an accuracy of around 55%, emphasizing the complexities of distinguishing between fake and legitimate news based solely on titles.

## Project Impact
This project sheds light on the critical issue of fake news in todayâ€™s media landscape. The results and methodologies used serve as a foundation for further exploration in improving classification accuracy and developing more sophisticated models to better tackle the challenge of misinformation.
